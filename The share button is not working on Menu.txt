The share button is not working on Menu

After buying from codecanyon, I configure the app properly and running successfully but the share button are showing only ‘share’ text.

It’s a bug of RocketWeb version 1.3.3 or bellows please update this line of code to resolve the issue.

R.string.menu_share -> UtilMethods.shareTheApp(mContext,
        "Download "+ getString(R.string.app_name)+"" +
                " app from play store. Click here: "+"" +
                "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id="+packageName+"/")
